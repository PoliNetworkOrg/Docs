# PoliNetwork Docs

Welcome to the PoliNetwork documentation site. Here you will find guides, tutorials,
and other resources to help you get started with contributing to PoliNetwork's projects.

## Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```sh
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

You can then serve your static build by running:

```sh
pnpm serve
```

### Deployment

This website is deployed using GitHub Pages. The deployment process is automated using GitHub Actions.
