# PoliNetwork's Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to PoliNetwork's technical documentation! This documentation is intended
to provide a somewhat comprehensive guide to many of PoliNetwork's projects.

## Infrastructure

We run our infrastructure on Azure (paid with the
[Microsoft Azure Sponsorship](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/))

If you want to learn how it works and how to add new services, check out the
[Infrastructure](/docs/infra/intro) section.

## Polifemo

This was an old app we wanted to build back when the official PoliMi app was
not as good as it is now. We never finished it, but you can still check out
the [Polifemo](/docs/app) section to see what we had in mind.
